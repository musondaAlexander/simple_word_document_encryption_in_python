# simple_word_document_encryption_in_python
This code uses a Python Library called cryptography.fernet to encode a Word document.
It generates a key, which is used to decode the document.
You can use this Program to do anything that you want.

In this code, I've added a select_file function that opens a file dialog to allow you to browse and select a Word document file. You can use this function to select the input and output files for encryption and decryption. The rest of the encryption and decryption logic remains the same as in the previous script.

# tk_encryption.py is used for word documents alone.
# encryption_all_file.py is used for any type of documents.
